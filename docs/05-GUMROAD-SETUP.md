# Gumroad Setup & Manual License Key Workflow

**Last Updated:** January 2025

---

## ðŸ“‹ Overview

**IMPORTANT:** BYT P&L Tracker uses a **pre-generated offline license key system**, NOT Gumroad's automatic license keys. This guide covers the complete setup process including the manual license key delivery workflow.

### License System Architecture
- **Key Generation:** Offline via `scripts/generate-keys.js` (in main app repo)
- **Key Storage:** CSV file (`license-keys.csv`) with columns: Key, Status, Email, Date
- **Key Validation:** Offline checksum verification (no internet required)
- **Key Delivery:** Manual email after purchase (3-5 minutes per sale)

### Why Manual License Keys?
- **Offline validation:** App works without internet connection
- **Security:** Keys are cryptographically validated by checksum
- **Control:** Full control over key distribution and revocation
- **Simple:** No API integration, no server-side logic
- **Automation later:** After 50+ sales, consider automation (out of scope for v1.0)

---

## Step 1: License System Overview

### How It Works

1. **Customer purchases** on Gumroad â†’ Receives download link
2. **You receive notification** via email from Gumroad
3. **You open** `license-keys.csv` and find an unused key
4. **You mark key as sold** (Status: sold, Email: customer email, Date: today)
5. **You email customer** the license key (separate email)
6. **Customer installs** app and enters license key
7. **App validates** key offline using checksum algorithm

### Files You Need
- `license-keys.csv` - Generated in main app repository
- License key email template (provided in Step 7)
- Purchase confirmation email template (provided in Step 7)

### Time Investment
- **Per sale:** 3-5 minutes (check dashboard â†’ open CSV â†’ mark key â†’ email customer)
- **Daily:** 5-10 minutes if checking Gumroad dashboard once per day
- **Automation threshold:** Consider automation after 50+ sales

```

**STEP E: Save CSV**
- Save file immediately
- Back up CSV file weekly

## Step 10: Future Automation (After 50+ Sales)

Once you have consistent sales (50+), consider automating the license key delivery:

### Automation Options

**Option 1: Zapier Integration**
- Trigger: New Gumroad sale
- Action: Send email with license key from CSV
- Cost: ~$20/month

**Option 2: Custom API**
- Build Node.js server with Express
- Webhook endpoint for Gumroad
- Auto-email license keys
- Cost: Server hosting (~$5-10/month)

**Option 3: Gumroad License Key API**
- Migrate to Gumroad's built-in license keys
- Use Gumroad's API for validation
- Requires app code changes (online validation)

### When to Automate

- **50+ sales:** Consider Zapier or simple script
- **100+ sales:** Invest in custom API
- **500+ sales:** Consider full license management system

### Cost-Benefit Analysis

**Manual (0-50 sales):**
- Cost: $0
- Time: 3-5 minutes per sale
- Total time: 2.5-4 hours for 50 sales

**Automated (50+ sales):**
- Cost: $20-50/month (Zapier or server)
- Time: 0 minutes per sale
- ROI: Positive after 50-100 sales
